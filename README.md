# Anthonys-Awsome-Game
This was a game I made in roughly a week as my final project for the Grade 12 computer science class.
# Ok, so here's how the game works
It's pretty trivial. On any given level: the player controls a red square using WASD (as always) and must navigate it to the finish stage while avoiding all the obstacles. Simple, right? <br />
Well, my game is less of a "game" and more of a tool users can use to create and test levels for the game proposed above. That is to say, the game has no definitive beginning or end. Its content is limited only by your imagination... aaand the amount of .txt files your computer can hold.
