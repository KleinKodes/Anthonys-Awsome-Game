# Anthonys-Awsome-Game
This was a game I made in roughly a week as my final project for the Grade 12 computer science class.
### Note: Run the start.java class to start the game. I never exported the project since our teacher wanted the source code for grading. 

# Skills Demonstraighted 
- Java (obviously)
- Object Oriented Programming
- Understanding of Software Design Patterns

# Ok, so here's how the game works
It's pretty trivial. On any given level: the player controls a red square using WASD (as always) and must navigate it to the finish stage while avoiding all the obstacles. Simple, right? <br />
Well, my game is less of a "game" and more of a tool users can use to create and test levels for the game proposed above. That is to say, the game has no definitive beginning or end. Its content is limited only by your imagination... aaand the amount of .txt files your computer can hold.

# The Level Editor
Aside from some pre-existing showcase levels you are gonna have to make your own, so here's how that's gonna work. <br />(By the way, the game suffers from some pretty bad performance issues so if it lags sometimes... just bare with it ok? I only had a week with this thing so I didn't have time to optimize it and I'm sure as hell not gonna do it now). <br />
- Walls: Very self-explanatory, just place them down and now the play can pass them.
- Coins: These are what the yellow circle is. The player must collect all of these before they can finish the level.
- Blue Balls: Please excuse the name... Anyways, these are moving balls the player must avoid, touching one means resetting the level. <br />
Try not to make too many levels ok? I just realize a year later that I never implemented a scrolling system onto the main menu meaning the levels will start to go off the screen if you have enough of them.
